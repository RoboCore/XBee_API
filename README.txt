	RoboCore XBee API Library
		(v1.1 - 26/02/2013)

  Library to use the XBEE in API mode
    (for Arduino 1.0.1 and later)

  Released under the Beerware licence
  
  
  NOTE: uses the Pointer List in XBeeMaster::Listen()
        (but can be changed by undefining
        USE_POINTER_LIST in <Memory.h>)
  
  NOTE: not compatible with previous versions of
        Arduino because of the SoftwareSerial library
